All energy is in kb scale

# Task 2.1.1
    

# Task 2.1.2

# Task 2.1.3
Negative J implies that the monomers favors attraction to minimize the total free energy in the system

# Task 2.1.4
Assuming tail and head moves like a free joint, so it can have two possible spots to move to.
If it has two possitions, i randomly chooses one (can take the one with smallest energy too)
